* Jekyll `regenerates` everything on every change. Every change in JS, CSS, HTML or markdown regenerates everything.

* Single view. I created raw.html plugin.

* Poor SASS support. Jekyll Asset pipeline solves it.

* Jekyll Asset pipeline missing out many features of Jekyll Asset bundler.

* Jekyll templates (Liquid) does not support minified output. Jade does.
